# NBARatingPrediction
NBA 2k is a series of video games involving basketball simulation, with a new game being made every NBA season. As a part of the game, real NBA Players are categorized into numerical ratings based on their real life performance for that season. So, by gathering this rating data, along with real life NBA Player statistical data, the first part of this project was using data analysis to explore the relationship between an NBA 2k rating, a salary, and the actual performance of NBA Players.

The second part of this project involved making two machine learning models; one of the models could predict the rating for a player based on the players stats, and the other could predict the salary of a player also based on their stats. From there, these machine learning models were used to create a local website in which it is possible to enter custom stats for a non-existant NBA Player, and get a predicted rating and salary, along with the percentiles of the rating and salary.
